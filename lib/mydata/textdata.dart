    Nature is full of patterns and humans have evolved to be amazing pattern recognizers 
    and even more importantly we have learned to take advantage of those patterns to create the modern world. 
    Mathmatics is essentially the attempt to represent these in a standardized way that can be shared from person to 
    person, generation to generation, and applied to a wide range of applications. This shared language is what makes math so powerful but also very intimidating to start.
      But I believe that by putting these ideas in the context of what problems they were invented to solve, they make a little more sense.

    Once you want to keep track of more than 10 things(or 20 if you count your toes), not having any sort of number system is problematic.
      So you decide you will represent 'fingers' by marking lines in the sand. You've just made the first leap towards the math you know and love today. 
      Humankind made this leap to using tally marks around 30,000BC, but unfortunately they got stuck there for ~25,000 years until the Egyptians and Mesopotamians 
    figured out how to represent numbers without having to use a tally mark for every single number. The concept of using a system with placeholders,
      like base 10, may not seem like a big deal but was, allowing the egyptians to manage large projects(like construction of the pyramids).
      The amout of space the system saves when representing large numbers is hard to even comprehend. Change the number in the box below to see.

    "Gettysburg Address":'''#italic##size12##fontfamMontserrat#Four score an#fw700#d seven years ago#fw400# our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and #fw700#dedicated to the proposition#fw400# that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a f#size14#inal resting place for th#size12#ose who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
