    Nature is full of patterns and humans have evolved to be amazing pattern recognizers 
    and even more importantly we have learned to take advantage of those patterns to create the modern world. 
    Mathmatics is essentially the attempt to represent these in a standardized way that can be shared from person to 
    person, generation to generation, and applied to a wide range of applications. This shared language is what makes math so powerful but also very intimidating to start.
      But I believe that by putting these ideas in the context of what problems they were invented to solve, they make a little more sense.

    Once you want to keep track of more than 10 things(or 20 if you count your toes), not having any sort of number system is problematic.
      So you decide you will represent 'fingers' by marking lines in the sand. You've just made the first leap towards the math you know and love today. 
      Humankind made this leap to using tally marks around 30,000BC, but unfortunately they got stuck there for ~25,000 years until the Egyptians and Mesopotamians 
    figured out how to represent numbers without having to use a tally mark for every single number. The concept of using a system with placeholders,
      like base 10, may not seem like a big deal but was, allowing the egyptians to manage large projects(like construction of the pyramids).
      The amout of space the system saves when representing large numbers is hard to even comprehend. Change the number in the box below to see.
